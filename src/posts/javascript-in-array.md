As of ES6 (ES2015), there's a new and easy way to check of an item exists in an array, also known as **in array**.

This is now possible by using the **Array.includes()** method which returns a boolean.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const names = ['Alex', 'Sam', 'Blane'];

names.includes('Alex'); //true
names.includes('Red'); //false
```

Notice how we call `.includes` on the array **names** and how it returns either true or false.

## Use cases

This is useful to check if an item exists in an array, however a more important use case is refactoring some if conditions. For example, assuming we want to check a variable **status**, instead of writing this long if condition:

```javascript
if (status === 'en_route' || status === 'pending' || status === 'on_hold') {
  // do something
}
```

You can refactor it to a much more readable condition using the **javascript in array** method you learned above:

```javascript
const statuses = ['en_route', 'pending', 'on_hold'];

if (statuses.includes(status)) {
  // do something
}
```

Notice how we define the allowed statuses in an array, and then call `statuses.includes(status)`, which will return either **true** or **false**.
