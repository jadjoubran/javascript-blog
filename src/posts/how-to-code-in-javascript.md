**JavaScript** is a programming language used to make
websites dynamic & interactive.

For example, it allows you to:

- Show a message when the user clicks on a button
- Hide a message when the user clicks on the close button
- Open a sidebar when the user swipes to the right from the edge of
  the screen
- Play a video when you click on the **play** button

**JavaScript** can also be used on the server side to
write the backend or API of your website. In that context it's called
**Node** or **NodeJs**.

On the frontend side, JavaScript is often used in combination with
**HTML** & **CSS**.

## Basics of JavaScript

Let's start with the basics of JavaScript by looking at a simple
example:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

This code defines a function (which is a reusable piece of code) called
**sum**. This means that you can now call
`sum(1, 3)` which returns **4**. You can run it
again with different values, such as `sum(2, 5)` and it will
return the result of `2 + 5` which is **7**.

### A note on the return keyword

The keyword **return** instructs the function that this is
the result of that function. Think of it as an operation and then when
it completes, it will give you the result of the sum.

## Strings

You can create a string in JavaScript by simply using the double
quotes (") or single quotes (') and later you will see the backtick
character.
Here's an example:

```javascript
'This is a string';
'this is another string!';
```

There is no difference between using a double quote or a single quote.
They are exactly the same. Both of these strings do not support
interpolation (which means having a variable inside of them).

### Basic String properties

The **.length** property is used to return the length of
the string. Here's an example of getting the length of
**"Nice!"**:

```javascript
'Nice!'.length;
// returns 5
```

### Basic String methods

Here are some common methods that you can call on strings:

#### .includes(searchString)

This method returns true when the searchString is included inside the
parent string. For example:

```javascript
'Hello World'.includes('Hello'); // true
'Hello World'.includes('Potato'); // false
```

#### .toUpperCase()

This will return a new string that has all of its characters in upper
case:

```javascript
'hello'.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO";
```

#### .toLowerCase()

This will return a new string that has all of its characters in lower
case:

```javascript
'NICe'.toLowerCase(); // "nice";
```

## Numbers

1, 2, 0, -5, 3.5, 2000, 2019, -23.51.
All of these are examples of Numbers in JavaScript. It doesn't matter if
it's negative or positive, if it has a decimal (values after the
**.**) or not. We call them numbers.

### Converting from number to string

You can convert a number to string by simply calling the .toString()
method. Let's take an example where we have a variable called answer
with a value 42:

```javascript
answer.toString(); //"42"
```

### Converting from string to number

In some scenarios, you'd like to convert from a string to a number.
For that, you'd have to use the
**Number.parseInt** method. Here's an example:

```javascript
Number.parseInt('42', 10); //42
```

Note that the **Number** in
**Number.parseInt("42")** is an Object in JavaScript that
contains methods related to numbers, and
**.parseInt()** is one of them. It's a method that you
call on **Number** to convert a string into a number.

The 2nd argument is called radix. A radix of 10 means that we're using
the decimal system. In short, humans use the decimal system (because
we have 10 fingers, from 0 to 9), and computers use the binary system
(on and off, 0s and 1s).

Unfortunately parseInt **does not default** to a radix of
10, thus it is recommended that you always specify it. If you omit the
radix, it may or may not work as you expect based on the string you
provided as a first argument. Thus to be safe, always specify the
radix.
